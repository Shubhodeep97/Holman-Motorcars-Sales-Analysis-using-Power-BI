# Business Analysis using Power BI : Holman Motorcars Sales Analysis

**Overview:**
The project involves analyzing the business data of Holman Motorcars, a company that caters to the luxury car market and meets customers' demands. The primary objective of this project is to assist the company and its stakeholders by converting their business data into useful insights. To achieve this goal, I created 3 comprehensive dashboards presenting the insights in a clear and understandable way. The entire project was completed using Power BI, a Business Intelligence tool that enables people to transform data into actionable insights, as well as stunning visualizations of insights and dashboards.

## Approach
To visualize the business forecast of Holman Motorcars, transforming the raw data, I created 3 interactive Dashboards that reflect the situation of the business during the year 2012 to 2015.

- Performance Analysis : The dashboard shows the overall Sales and Cost Analysis of Luxury Automobiles across Europe and US and also shows how Sales and Costs are depending on different parameters i.e. vehicle type, make, model etc. 

- Labor Cost Analysis : This dashboard depicts the image of Labor Cost and how it depends on different key factors i.e. different reporting years (2012 - 2015), country name, vehicle type etc.

- Discount & Sales Analysis : The dashboard shows the discount analysis on different parameters along with the sales.
## Findings

-  Performance Analysis ->
The Total Sale Price was 32M and Cost Price was 20M along with the Labor Cost of 310K from the year 2012 to 2015. Thus the company made a profit of 11.69M overall in that period.

The vehicle type 'Coupe' was more in demand having net sales of 15M which was 48.68% of the total sales, then came the type 'Saloon' with 14M which was close to 'Coupe' in terms of sales and also it was sharing 45.08% of the total sales. The remaining type 'Convertible' had much lesser demand as compared to the type 'Coupe' and 'Saloon'. It contributed only 2M Sales which is only 6.24% of the total sales.

When we consider the top 5 brands based on their sales, we notice that 'Aston Martin' had the highest sales among all the brands, which were around 10.7 million. Following that was 'Rolls Royce' with 7.4 million in sales, then 'Jaguar' with 6.3 million in sales, 'Bentley' with 5 million in sales, and 'MGB' with only 1 million in sales. The other brands had sales figures that were either close to or much lower than that of 'MGB'.

If we analyze the sales figures for each reporting year, we notice that in 2012, the sale was only 2 million. However, in 2013, it increased significantly to 7.2 million but then decreased to 6.4 million in 2014. In 2015, the sales began to increase once more and reached a staggering 15 million in just one year.

In terms of cost, the order of models by most expensive to least expensive in making them is: 'XK' (3.8M), 'DB9' (3.2M), 'Continental' (2.5M), 'Camargue' (2.4M), and 'Silver Ghost' (0.9M).
The top 5 clients in terms of purchase were, "Wheels'R'Us", 'Bright Orange', 'Aldo Motors', "Cut'n'Shut" and 'Honest John'


- Labor Cost Analysis ->


Here we have multiple clients for whom our company has borne different labour costs. The highest labour cost, amounting to around 26K, has been borne by our company for 'Aldo Motors'. The following clients that had a similar rank in terms of labour costs are 'Cut'n'Shut' (23K), 'Bright Orange' (23K), 'Honest John' (23K), and 'Wheels'R'Us'. 'Premium Motor Vehicles' has the least amount of labour cost spent by the Holman, which is only around 500.

If we consider the reporting years, we can observe that the least amount of labour cost borne by the company was in 2012, which amounted to around 31K. In 2013, the labour cost had increased to 74K, but in 2014, it had reduced again to 62K. However, in 2015, the labour cost had surged to 144K, making it the highest to date.

In terms of Countries, We had the highest labour cost for the United Kingdom (0.13M), then came the USA (0.11M), France (0.04M), Switzerland (0.03M) etc.

Considering the type, we found that the highest demand was for the "Coupe" type, which also had the highest labour cost of 151K, followed by "Saloon" (131K) and "Convertible" (28K).


- Discount and Sales Analysis ->

We have information on the maximum total discount for the 'DB9' model and the minimum total discount for the 'Zagato' model. Additionally, we can see that the maximum total discount was applied to the 'Aston Martin' brand, followed by 'Jaguar', 'Bentley', 'Rolls Royce', 'Triumph', and others. 

The two countries with the highest total discount were the USA and UK, followed by France and Switzerland. On the other hand, Spain and Germany had the least total discount applied to the cars.

We have visualized the country-wise sales, indicating that the UK had the highest sales with 16 million, followed by the USA with 12 million, France with 3 million, and Switzerland with 1 million.
